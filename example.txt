<act 1>


<scene 1>
<athens. the palace of theseus.>
<stage dir>
<enter theseus, hippolyta, philostrate, and attendants.>
</stage dir>
<theseus>	<1%>
	now, fair hippolyta, our nuptial hour
	draws on apace: four happy days bring in
	another moon; but o! methinks how slow
	this old moon wanes; she lingers my desires,
	like to a step dame, or a dowager
	long withering out a young man's revenue.
</theseus>

<hippolyta>	<1%>
	four days will quickly steep themselves in night;
	four nights will quickly dream away the time;
	and then the moon, like to a silver bow
	new-bent in heaven, shall behold the night
	of our solemnities.
</hippolyta>

<theseus>	<1%>
	go, philostrate,
	stir up the athenian youth to merriments;
	awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;
	turn melancholy forth to funerals;
	the pale companion is not for our pomp.
<stage dir>
<exit philostrate.>
</stage dir>
	hippolyta, i woo'd thee with my sword,
	and won thy love doing thee injuries;
	but i will wed thee in another key,
	with pomp, with triumph, and with revelling.

</theseus>
<stage dir>
<enter egeus, hermia, lysander, and demetrius.>
</stage dir>
<egeus>	<1%>
	happy be theseus, our renowned duke!
</egeus>

<theseus>	<2%>
	thanks, good egeus: what's the news with thee?
</theseus>

<egeus>	<2%>
	full of vexation come i, with complaint
	against my child, my daughter hermia.
	stand forth, demetrius. my noble lord,
	this man hath my consent to marry her.
	stand forth, lysander: and, my gracious duke,
	this man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child:
	thou, thou, lysander, thou hast given her rimes,
	and interchang'd love-tokens with my child;
	thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
	with feigning voice, verses of feigning love;
	and stol'n the impression of her fantasy
	with bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,
	knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers
	of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth;
	with cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart;
	turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,
	to stubborn harshness. and, my gracious duke,
	be it so she will not here before your grace
	consent to marry with demetrius,
	i beg the ancient privilege of athens,
	as she is mine, i may dispose of her;
	which shall be either to this gentleman,
	or to her death, according to our law
	immediately provided in that case.
</egeus>

<theseus>	<3%>
	what say you, hermia? be advis'd, fair maid.
	to you, your father should be as a god;
	one that compos'd your beauties, yea, and one
	to whom you are but as a form in wax
	by him imprinted, and within his power
	to leave the figure or disfigure it.
	demetrius is a worthy gentleman.
</theseus>

<hermia>	<3%>
	so is lysander.
</hermia>

<theseus>	<3%>
	in himself he is;
	but, in this kind, wanting your father's voice,
	the other must be held the worthier.
</theseus>

<hermia>	<3%>
	i would my father look'd but with my eyes.
</hermia>

<theseus>	<3%>
	rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
</theseus>

<hermia>	<3%>
	i do entreat your grace to pardon me.
	i know not by what power i am made bold,
	nor how it may concern my modesty
	in such a presence here to plead my thoughts;
	but i beseech your grace, that i may know
	the worst that may befall me in this case,
	if i refuse to wed demetrius.
</hermia>

<theseus>	<3%>
	either to die the death, or to abjure
	for ever the society of men.
	therefore, fair hermia, question your desires;
	know of your youth, examine well your blood,
	whe'r, if you yield not to your father's choice,
	you can endure the livery of a nun,
	for aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,
	to live a barren sister all your life,
	chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
	thrice blessed they that master so their blood,
	to undergo such maiden pilgrimage;
	but earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,
	than that which withering on the virgin thorn
	grows, lives, and dies, in single blessedness.
</theseus>

<hermia>	<4%>
	so will i grow, so live, so die, my lord,
	ere i will yield my virgin patent up
	unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke
	my soul consents not to give sovereignty.
</hermia>

<theseus>	<4%>
	take time to pause; and, by the next new moon,—
	the sealing-day betwixt my love and me
	for everlasting bond of fellowship,—
	upon that day either prepare to die
	for disobedience to your father's will,
	or else to wed demetrius, as he would;
	or on diana's altar to protest
	for aye austerity and single life.
</theseus>

<demetrius>	<5%>
	relent, sweet hermia; and, lysander, yield
	thy crazed title to my certain right.
</demetrius>

<lysander>	<5%>
	you have her father's love, demetrius;
	let me have hermia's: do you marry him.
</lysander>

<egeus>	<5%>
	scornful lysander! true, he hath my love,
	and what is mine my love shall render him;
	and she is mine, and all my right of her
	i do estate unto demetrius.
</egeus>

<lysander>	<5%>
	i am, my lord, as well deriv'd as he,
	as well possess'd; my love is more than his;
	my fortunes every way as fairly rank'd
	if not with vantage, as demetrius';
	and, which is more than all these boasts can be,
	i am belov'd of beauteous hermia.
	why should not i then prosecute my right?
	demetrius, i'll avouch it to his head,
	made love to nedar's daughter, helena,
	and won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
	devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,
	upon this spotted and inconstant man.
</lysander>

<theseus>	<5%>
	i must confess that i have heard so much,
	and with demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;
	but, being over-full of self-affairs,
	my mind did lose it. but, demetrius, come;
	and come, egeus; you shall go with me,
	i have some private schooling for you both.
	for you, fair hermia, look you arm yourself
	to fit your fancies to your father's will,
	or else the law of athens yields you up,
	which by no means we may extenuate,
	to death, or to a vow of single life.
	come, my hippolyta: what cheer, my love?
	demetrius and egeus, go along:
	i must employ you in some business
	against our nuptial, and confer with you
	of something nearly that concerns yourselves.
</theseus>

<egeus>	<6%>
	with duty and desire we follow you.
</egeus>
<stage dir>
<exeunt theseus, hippolyta, egeus, demetrius, and train.>
</stage dir>

<lysander>	<6%>
	how now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?
	how chance the roses there do fade so fast?
</lysander>

<hermia>	<6%>
	belike for want of rain, which i could well
	beteem them from the tempest of mine eyes.
</hermia>

<lysander>	<6%>
	ay me! for aught that ever i could read,
	could ever hear by tale or history,
	the course of true love never did run smooth;
	but, either it was different in blood,—
</lysander>

<hermia>	<7%>
	o cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.
</hermia>

<lysander>	<7%>
	or else misgraffed in respect of years,—
</lysander>

<hermia>	<7%>
	o spite! too old to be engag'd to young.
</hermia>

<lysander>	<7%>
	or else it stood upon the choice of friends,—
</lysander>

<hermia>	<7%>
	o hell! to choose love by another's eye.
</hermia>

<lysander>	<7%>
	or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
	war, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,
	making it momentany as a sound,
	swift as a shadow, short as any dream,
	brief as the lightning in the collied night,
	that, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,
	and ere a man hath power to say, 'behold!'
	the jaws of darkness do devour it up:
	so quick bright things come to confusion.
</lysander>

<hermia>	<7%>
	if then true lovers have been ever cross'd,
	it stands as an edict in destiny:
	then let us teach our trial patience,
	because it is a customary cross,
	as due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,
	wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.
</hermia>

<lysander>	<8%>
	a good persuasion: therefore, hear me, hermia.
	i have a widow aunt, a dowager
	of great revenue, and she hath no child:
	from athens is her house remote seven leagues;
	and she respects me as her only son.
	there, gentle hermia, may i marry thee,
	and to that place the sharp athenian law
	cannot pursue us. if thou lov'st me then,
	steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night,
	and in the wood, a league without the town,
	where i did meet thee once with helena,
	to do observance to a morn of may,
	there will i stay for thee.
</lysander>

<hermia>	<8%>
	my good lysander!
	i swear to thee by cupid's strongest bow,
	by his best arrow with the golden head,
	by the simplicity of venus' doves,
	by that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,
	and by that fire which burn'd the carthage queen,
	when the false troyan under sail was seen,
	by all the vows that ever men have broke,—
	in number more than ever women spoke,—
	in that same place thou hast appointed me,
	to-morrow truly will i meet with thee.
</hermia>

<lysander>	<9%>
	keep promise, love. look, here comes helena.

</lysander>
<stage dir>
<enter helena.>
</stage dir>
<hermia>	<9%>
	god speed fair helena! whither away?
</hermia>

<helena>	<9%>
	call you me fair? that fair again unsay.
	demetrius loves your fair: o happy fair!
	your eyes are lode-stars! and your tongue's sweet air
	more tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,
	when wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.
	sickness is catching: o! were favour so,
	yours would i catch, fair hermia, ere i go;
	my ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,
	my tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.
	were the world mine, demetrius being bated,
	the rest i'd give to be to you translated.
	o! teach me how you look, and with what art
	you sway the motion of demetrius' heart.
</helena>

<hermia>	<9%>
	i frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
</hermia>

<helena>	<9%>
	o! that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill.
</helena>

<hermia>	<9%>
	i give him curses, yet he gives me love.
</hermia>

<helena>	<9%>
	o! that my prayers could such affection move.
</helena>

<hermia>	<9%>
	the more i hate, the more he follows me.
</hermia>

<helena>	<10%>
	the more i love, the more he hateth me.
</helena>

<hermia>	<10%>
	his folly, helena, is no fault of mine.
</hermia>

<helena>	<10%>
	none, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!
</helena>

<hermia>	<10%>
	take comfort: he no more shall see my face;
	lysander and myself will fly this place.
	before the time i did lysander see,
	seem'd athens as a paradise to me:
	o! then, what graces in my love do dwell,
	that he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell.
</hermia>

<lysander>	<10%>
	helen, to you our minds we will unfold.
	to-morrow night, when phœbe doth behold
	her silver visage in the wat'ry glass,
	decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,—
	a time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,—
	through athens' gates have we devis'd to steal.
</lysander>

<hermia>	<10%>
	and in the wood, where often you and i
	upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,
	emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,
	there my lysander and myself shall meet;
	and thence from athens turn away our eyes,
	to seek new friends and stranger companies.
	farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;
	and good luck grant thee thy demetrius!
	keep word, lysander: we must starve our sight
	from lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.
</hermia>

<lysander>	<11%>
	i will, my hermia.—<stage dir>
<exit hermia.>
</stage dir> helena, adieu:
	as you on him, demetrius dote on you!
</lysander>
<stage dir>
<exit.>
</stage dir>

<helena>	<11%>
	how happy some o'er other some can be!
	through athens i am thought as fair as she;
	but what of that? demetrius thinks not so;
	he will not know what all but he do know;
	and as he errs, doting on hermia's eyes,
	so i, admiring of his qualities.
	things base and vile, holding no quantity,
	love can transpose to form and dignity.
	love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind,
	and therefore is wing'd cupid painted blind.
	nor hath love's mind of any judgment taste;
	wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:
	and therefore is love said to be a child,
	because in choice he is so oft beguil'd.
	as waggish boys in game themselves forswear,
	so the boy love is perjur'd every where;
	for ere demetrius look'd on hermia's eyne,
	he hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;
	and when this hail some heat from hermia felt,
	so he dissolv'd, and showers of oaths did melt.
	i will go tell him of fair hermia's flight:
	then to the wood will he to-morrow night
	pursue her; and for this intelligence
	if i have thanks, it is a dear expense:
	but herein mean i to enrich my pain,
	to have his sight thither and back again.

</stage dir>
<quince>	<12%>
	is all our company here?
</quince>

<bottom>	<12%>
	you were best to call them generally, man by man, according to the scrip.
</bottom>

<quince>	<12%>
	here is the scroll of every man's name, which is thought fit, through all athens, to play in our interlude before the duke and the duchess on his wedding-day at night.
</quince>

<bottom>	<12%>
	first, good peter quince, say what the play treats on; then read the names of the actors, and so grow to a point.
</bottom>

<quince>	<13%>
	marry, our play is, the most lamentable comedy, and most cruel death of pyramus and thisby.
</quince>

<bottom>	<13%>
	a very good piece of work, i assure you, and a merry. now, good peter quince, call forth your actors by the scroll. masters, spread yourselves.
</bottom>

<quince>	<13%>
	answer as i call you. nick bottom, the weaver.
</quince>

<bottom>	<13%>
	ready. name what part i am for, and proceed.
</bottom>

<quince>	<13%>
	you, nick bottom, are set down for pyramus.
</quince>

<bottom>	<13%>
	what is pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?
</bottom>

<quince>	<13%>
	a lover, that kills himself most gallantly for love.
</quince>

<bottom>	<13%>
	that will ask some tears in the true performing of it: if i do it, let the audience look to their eyes; i will move storms, i will condole in some measure. to the rest: yet my chief humour is for a tyrant. i could play ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in, to make all split.

	the raging rocks
	and shivering shocks
	shall break the locks
	of prison gates:
	and phibbus' car
	shall shine from far
	and make and mar
	the foolish fates.

	this was lofty! now name the rest of the players. this is ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein; a lover is more condoling.
</bottom>

<quince>	<14%>
	francis flute, the bellows-mender.
</quince>

<flute>	<14%>
	here, peter quince.
</flute>

<quince>	<14%>
	you must take thisby on you.
</quince>

<flute>	<14%>
	what is thisby? a wandering knight?
</flute>

<quince>	<14%>
	it is the lady that pyramus must love.
</quince>

<flute>	<14%>
	nay, faith, let not me play a woman; i have a beard coming.
</flute>

<quince>	<14%>
	that's all one: you shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as small as you will.
</quince>

<bottom>	<14%>
	an i may hide my face, let me play thisby too. i'll speak in a monstrous little voice, 'thisne, thisne!' 'ah, pyramus, my lover dear; thy thisby dear, and lady dear!'
</bottom>

<quince>	<14%>
	no, no; you must play pyramus; and flute, you thisby.
</quince>

<bottom>	<14%>
	well, proceed.
</bottom>

<quince>	<14%>
	robin starveling, the tailor.
</quince>

<starveling>	<14%>
	here, peter quince.
</starveling>

<quince>	<14%>
	robin starveling, you must play thisby's mother. tom snout, the tinker.
</quince>

<snout>	<14%>
	here, peter quince.
</snout>

<quince>	<15%>
	you, pyramus's father; myself, thisby's father; snug, the joiner, you the lion's part: and, i hope, here is a play fitted.
</quince>

<snug>	<15%>
	have you the lion's part written? pray you, if it be, give it me, for i am slow of study.
</snug>

<quince>	<15%>
	you may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.
</quince>

<bottom>	<15%>
	let me play the lion too. i will roar, that i will do any man's heart good to hear me; i will roar, that i will make the duke say, 'let him roar again, let him roar again.'
</bottom>

<quince>	<15%>
	an you should do it too terribly, you would fright the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek; and that were enough to hang us all.
</quince>

<all>	<15%>
	that would hang us, every mother's son.
</all>

<bottom>	<15%>
	i grant you, friends, if that you should fright the ladies out of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang us; but i will aggravate my voice so that i will roar you as gently as any sucking dove; i will roar you as 'twere any nightingale.
</bottom>

<quince>	<15%>
	you can play no part but pyramus; for pyramus is a sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a summer's day; a most lovely, gentleman-like man; therefore, you must needs play pyramus.
</quince>

<bottom>	<16%>
	well, i will undertake it. what beard were i best to play it in?
</bottom>

<quince>	<16%>
	why, what you will.
</quince>

<bottom>	<16%>
	i will discharge it in either your straw-colour beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your french-crown colour beard, your perfect yellow.
</bottom>

<quince>	<16%>
	some of your french crowns have no hair at all, and then you will play bare-faced. but masters, here are your parts; and i am to entreat you, request you, and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night, and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the town, by moonlight: there will we rehearse; for if we meet in the city, we shall be dogged with company, and our devices known. in the meantime i will draw a bill of properties, such as our play wants. i pray you, fail me not.
</quince>

<bottom>	<16%>
	we will meet; and there we may rehearse more obscenely and courageously. take pains; be perfect; adieu.
</bottom>

<quince>	<17%>
	at the duke's oak we meet.

	how now, spirit! whither wander you?
</puck>

<fairy>	<17%>

	over hill, over dale,
	thorough bush, thorough brier,
	over park, over pale,
	thorough flood, thorough fire,
	i do wander every where,
	swifter than the moone's sphere;
	and i serve the fairy queen,
	to dew her orbs upon the green:
	the cowslips tall her pensioners be;
	in their gold coats spots you see;
	those be rubies, fairy favours,
	in their freckles live their savours:

	i must go seek some dew-drops here,
	and hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
	farewell, thou lob of spirits: i'll be gone;
	our queen and all her elves come here anon.
</fairy>

<puck>	<17%>
	the king doth keep his revels here to-night.
	take heed the queen come not within his sight;
	for oberon is passing fell and wrath,
	because that she as her attendant hath
	a lovely boy, stol'n from an indian king;
	she never had so sweet a changeling;
	and jealous oberon would have the child
	knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
	but she, perforce, withholds the loved boy,
	crowns him with flowers, and makes him all her joy.
	and now they never meet in grove, or green,
	by fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,
	but they do square; that all their elves, for fear,
	creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.
</puck>

<fairy>	<18%>
	either i mistake your shape and making quite,
	or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
	call'd robin goodfellow: are you not he
	that frights the maidens of the villagery;
	skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern,
	and bootless make the breathless housewife churn;
	and sometime make the drink to bear no barm;
	mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?
	those that hobgoblin call you and sweet puck,
	you do their work, and they shall have good luck:
	are you not he?
</fairy>

<puck>	<19%>
	fairy, thou speak'st aright;
	i am that merry wanderer of the night.
	i jest to oberon, and make him smile
	when i a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,
	neighing in likeness of a filly foal:
	and sometime lurk i in a gossip's bowl,
	in very likeness of a roasted crab;
	and, when she drinks, against her lips i bob
	and on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.
	the wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,
	sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;
	then slip i from her bum, down topples she,
	and 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;
	and then the whole quire hold their hips and loff;
	and waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and swear
	a merrier hour was never wasted there.
	but, room, fairy! here comes oberon.
</puck>

	ill met by moonlight, proud titania.
</oberon>

<titania>	<20%>
	what! jealous oberon. fairies, skip hence:
	i have forsworn his bed and company.
</titania>

<oberon>	<20%>
	tarry, rash wanton! am not i thy lord?
</oberon>

<titania>	<20%>
	then, i must be thy lady; but i know
	when thou hast stol'n away from fairy land,
	and in the shape of corin sat all day,
	playing on pipes of corn, and versing love
	to amorous phillida. why art thou here,
	come from the furthest steppe of india?
	but that, forsooth, the bouncing amazon,
	your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,
	to theseus must be wedded, and you come
	to give their bed joy and prosperity.
</titania>

<oberon>	<20%>
	how canst thou thus for shame, titania,
	glance at my credit with hippolyta,
	knowing i know thy love to theseus?
	didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night

	these are the forgeries of jealousy:
	and never, since the middle summer's spring,
	met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,
	by paved fountain, or by rushy brook,
	or in the beached margent of the sea,
	to dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,
	but with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.
	therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,
	as in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea
	contagious fogs; which, falling in the land,
	have every pelting river made so proud
	that they have overborne their continents:
	the ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,
	the ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn
	hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard:
	the fold stands empty in the drowned field,
	and crows are fatted with the murrion flock;
	the nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,
	and the quaint mazes in the wanton green
	for lack of tread are undistinguishable:
	the human mortals want their winter here:
	no night is now with hymn or carol blest:
	therefore the moon, the governess of floods,
	pale in her anger, washes all the air,
	that rheumatic diseases do abound:
	and thorough this distemperature we see
	the seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts
	fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,
	and on old hiems' thin and icy crown
	an odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
	is, as in mockery, set. the spring, the summer,
	the childing autumn, angry winter, change
	their wonted liveries, and the mazed world,
	by their increase, now knows not which is which.
	and this same progeny of evil comes
	from our debate, from our dissension:
	we are their parents and original.

	following,—her womb then rich with my young squire,—
	would imitate, and sail upon the land,
	to fetch me trifles, and return again,

	cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took
	at a fair vestal throned by the west,
	and loos'd his love-shaft smartly from his bow,
	as it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;
	but i might see young cupid's fiery shaft
	quench'd in the chaste beams of the wat'ry moon,
	and the imperial votaress passed on,
	in maiden meditation, fancy-free.
	yet mark'd i where the bolt of cupid fell:
	it fell upon a little western flower,
	before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,
	and maidens call it, love-in-idleness.

<puck>	<46%>
	my mistress with a monster is in love.
	near to her close and consecrated bower,
	while she was in her dull and sleeping hour,
	a crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
	that work for bread upon athenian stalls,
	were met together to rehearse a play
	intended for great theseus' nuptial day.
	the shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,
	who pyramus presented in their sport
	forsook his scene, and enter'd in a brake,
	when i did him at this advantage take;
	an ass's nowl i fixed on his head:
	anon his thisbe must be answered,
	and forth my mimick comes. when they him spy,
	as wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,
	or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,
	rising and cawing at the gun's report,
	sever themselves, and madly sweep the sky;
	so, at his sight, away his fellows fly,
	and, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one falls;
	he murder cries, and help from athens calls.
	their sense thus weak, lost with their fears thus strong,
	made senseless things begin to do them wrong;
	for briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;
	some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all things catch.
	i led them on in this distracted fear,
	and left sweet pyramus translated there;
	when in that moment, so it came to pass,
	titania wak'd and straightway lov'd an ass.
</puck>

<oberon>	<47%>

<hermia>	<48%>
	now i but chide; but i should use thee worse,
	for thou, i fear, hast given me cause to curse.
	if thou hast slain lysander in his sleep,
	being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in knee deep,
	and kill me too.
	the sun was not so true unto the day
	as he to me. would he have stol'n away
	from sleeping hermia? i'll believe as soon
	this whole earth may be bor'd, and that the moon
	may through the centre creep, and so displease
	her brother's noontide with the antipodes.
	it cannot be but thou hast murder'd him;
	so should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.

<hermia>	<49%>

	durst thou have look'd upon him being awake,

</hermia>

<helena>	<60%>
	good hermia, do not be so bitter with me.
	i evermore did love you, hermia,
	did ever keep your counsels, never wrong'd you;
	save that, in love unto demetrius,
	i told him of your stealth unto this wood.
	he follow'd you; for love i follow'd him;
	but he hath chid me hence, and threaten'd me
	to strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:
	and now, so you will let me quiet go,
	to athens will i bear my folly back,
	and follow you no further: let me go:
	you see how simple and how fond i am.
</helena>

<hermia>	<61%>
	why, get you gone. who is't that hinders you?
</hermia>

<helena>	<61%>
	a foolish heart, that i leave here behind.

<demetrius>	<61%>
	no, sir; she shall not, though you take her part.
</demetrius>

<helena>	<61%>
	o! when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd.
	she was a vixen when she went to school:
	and though she be but little, she is fierce.
</helena>

<hermia>	<61%>
	'little' again! nothing but 'low' and 'little!'
	why will you suffer her to flout me thus?
	let me come to her.

	you minimus, of hindering knot-grass made;

	you are too officious
	in her behalf that scorns your services.
	let her alone; speak not of helena;
	take not her part, for, if thou dost intend
	never so little show of love to her,
	thou shalt aby it.
</demetrius>

<lysander>	<61%>
	now she holds me not;
	now follow, if thou dar'st, to try whose right,

	and sometime rail thou like demetrius;
	and from each other look thou lead them thus,
	till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep
	with leaden legs and batty wings doth creep:
	then crush this herb into lysander's eye;
	whose liquor hath this virtuous property,
	to take from thence all error with his might,
	and make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.
	when they next wake, all this derision
	shall seem a dream and fruitless vision;
	and back to athens shall the lovers wend,
	with league whose date till death shall never end.
	whiles i in this affair do thee employ,

	for, meeting her of late behind the wood,
	seeking sweet favours for this hateful fool,
	i did upbraid her and fall out with her;
	for she his hairy temples then had rounded
	with coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;
	and that same dew, which sometime on the buds
	was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,
	stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes
	like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
	when i had at my pleasure taunted her,
	and she in mild terms begg'd my patience,
	i then did ask of her her changeling child;
	which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent
	to bear him to my bower in fairy land.
	and now i have the boy, i will undo
	this hateful imperfection of her eyes:
	and, gentle puck, take this transformed scalp
	from off the head of this athenian swain,
	that he, awaking when the other do,
	may all to athens back again repair,

	seem'd all one mutual cry. i never heard
	so musical a discord, such sweet thunder.

	my hounds are bred out of the spartan kind,

	slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells,

	enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
	i beg the law, the law, upon his head.

	of my consent that she should be your wife.

<demetrius>	<76%>
	my lord, fair helen told me of their stealth,
	of this their purpose hither, to this wood;
	and i in fury hither follow'd them,
	fair helena in fancy following me.
	but, my good lord, i wot not by what power,—
	but by some power it is,—my love to hermia,
	melted as doth the snow, seems to me now
	as the remembrance of an idle gaud
	which in my childhood i did dote upon;
	and all the faith, the virtue of my heart,
	the object and the pleasure of mine eye,
	is only helena. to her, my lord,
	was i betroth'd ere i saw hermia:
	but, like in sickness, did i loathe this food;
	but, as in health, come to my natural taste,
	now do i wish it, love it, long for it,
	and will for evermore be true to it.

<theseus>	<76%>
	fair lovers, you are fortunately met:

	'tis strange, my theseus, that these lovers speak of.
</hippolyta>

<theseus>	<81%>
	more strange than true. i never may believe
	these antique fables, nor these fairy toys.
	lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
	such shaping fantasies, that apprehend
	more than cool reason ever comprehends.
	the lunatic, the lover, and the poet,
	are of imagination all compact:
	one sees more devils than vast hell can hold,
	that is, the madman; the lover, all as frantic,
	sees helen's beauty in a brow of egypt:
	the poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,
	doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;
	and, as imagination bodies forth
	the forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
	turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing
	a local habitation and a name.
	such tricks hath strong imagination,
	that, if it would but apprehend some joy,
	it comprehends some bringer of that joy;
	or in the night, imagining some fear,
	how easy is a bush suppos'd a bear!
</theseus>

<hippolyta>	<82%>
	but all the story of the night told over,
	and all their minds transfigur'd so together,
	more witnesseth than fancy's images,
	and grows to something of great constancy,
	but, howsoever, strange and admirable.

	tearing the thracian singer in their rage.
	that is an old device; and it was play'd
	when i from thebes came last a conqueror.
	the thrice three muses mourning for the death
	of learning, late deceas'd in beggary.
	that is some satire keen and critical,
	not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.
	a tedious brief scene of young pyramus
	and his love thisbe; very tragical mirth.
	merry and tragical! tedious and brief!
	that is, hot ice and wonderous strange snow.

	a play there is, my lord, some ten words long,
	which is as brief as i have known a play;
	but by ten words, my lord, it is too long,
	which makes it tedious; for in all the play
	there is not one word apt, one player fitted.
	and tragical, my noble lord, it is;
	for pyramus therein doth kill himself.
	which when i saw rehears'd, i must confess,
	made mine eyes water; but more merry tears
	the passion of loud laughter never shed.

<philostrate>	<84%>
	no, my noble lord;
	it is not for you: i have heard it over,

	unless you can find sport in their intents,
	extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
	to do you service.
</philostrate>

<theseus>	<85%>

	where i have come, great clerks have purposed
	to greet me with premeditated welcomes;
	where i have seen them shiver and look pale,
	make periods in the midst of sentences,
	throttle their practis'd accent in their fears,
	and, in conclusion, dumbly have broke off,
	not paying me a welcome. trust me, sweet,
	out of this silence yet i pick'd a welcome;

	this man is pyramus, if you would know;

	this man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
	wall, that vile wall which did these lovers sunder;
	and through wall's chink, poor souls, they are content
	to whisper, at the which let no man wonder.
	this man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
	presenteth moonshine; for, if you will know,
	by moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
	to meet at ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
	this grisly beast, which lion hight by name,
	the trusty thisby, coming first by night,
	did scare away, or rather did affright;
	and, as she fied, her mantle she did fall,
	which lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
	anon comes pyramus, sweet youth and tall,
	and finds his trusty thisby's mantle slain:
	whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
	he bravely broach'd his boiling bloody breast;
	and thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,

<scene 1>
<an orchard near oliver's house. enter orlando and adam.>
<orlando>	<0%>
	as i remember, adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou sayest, charged my brother on his blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my sadness. my brother jaques he keeps at school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part, he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that differs not from the stalling of an ox? his horses are bred better; for, besides that they are fair with their feeding, they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly hired: but i, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth, for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as i. besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave me, his countenance seems to take from me: he lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my education. this is it, adam, that grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which i think is within me, begins to mutiny against this servitude. i will no longer endure it, though yet i know no wise remedy how to avoid it.
</orlando>

<adam>	<1%>
	yonder comes my master, your brother.
</adam>

<orlando>	<1%>
	go apart, adam, and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up.

</stage dir>
<oliver>	<2%>
	now, sir! what make you here?
</oliver>

<orlando>	<2%>
	nothing: i am not taught to make anything.
</orlando>

<oliver>	<2%>
	what mar you then, sir?
</oliver>

<orlando>	<2%>
	marry, sir, i am helping you to mar that which god made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.
</orlando>

<oliver>	<2%>
	marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.
</oliver>

<orlando>	<2%>
	shall i keep your hogs, and eat husks with them? what prodigal portion have i spent, that i should come to such penury?
</orlando>

<oliver>	<2%>
	know you where you are, sir?
</oliver>

<orlando>	<2%>
	o! sir, very well: here in your orchard.
</orlando>

<oliver>	<2%>
	know you before whom, sir?
</oliver>

<orlando>	<2%>
	ay, better than he i am before knows me. i know you are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle condition of blood, you should so know me. the courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that you are the first-born; but the same tradition takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt us. i have as much of my father in me as you; albeit, i confess, your coming before me is nearer to his reverence.
</orlando>

<oliver>	<2%>
	what, boy!
</oliver>

<orlando>	<2%>
	come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.
</orlando>

<oliver>	<2%>
	wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?
</oliver>

<orlando>	<2%>
	i am no villain; i am the youngest son of sir rowland de boys; he was my father, and he is thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains. wert thou not my brother, i would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.
</orlando>

<adam>	<3%>
<stage dir>
<coming forward.>
</stage dir> sweet masters, be patient: for your father's remembrance, be at accord.
</adam>

<oliver>	<3%>
	let me go, i say.
</oliver>

<orlando>	<3%>
	i will not, till i please: you shall hear me. my father charged you in his will to give me good education: you have trained me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like qualities. the spirit of my father grows strong in me, and i will no longer endure it; therefore allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament; with that i will go buy my fortunes.
</orlando>

<oliver>	<3%>
	and what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent? well, sir, get you in: i will not long be troubled with you; you shall have some part of your will: i pray you, leave me.
</oliver>

<orlando>	<3%>
	i will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.
</orlando>

<oliver>	<3%>
	get you with him, you old dog.
</oliver>

<adam>	<3%>
	is 'old dog' my reward? most true, i have lost my teeth in your service. god be with my old master! he would not have spoke such a word.
</adam>
<stage dir>
<exeunt orlando and adam.>

<oliver>	<3%>
	is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? i will physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand crowns neither. holla, dennis!

<oliver>	<4%>
	was not charles the duke's wrestler here to speak with me?
</oliver>

<dennis>	<4%>
	so please you, he is here at the door, and importunes access to you.

</oliver>
<stage dir>
<enter charles.>
</stage dir>
<charles>	<4%>
	good morrow to your worship.
</charles>

<oliver>	<4%>
	good monsieur charles, what's the new news at the new court?
</oliver>

<charles>	<4%>
	there's no news at the court, sir, but the old news: that is, the old duke is banished by his younger brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary exile with him, whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke; therefore he gives them good leave to wander.
</charles>

<oliver>	<4%>
	can you tell if rosalind, the duke's daughter, be banished with her father?
</oliver>

<charles>	<4%>
	o, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves her,—being ever from their cradles bred together,—that she would have followed her exile, or have died to stay behind her. she is at the court, and no less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and never two ladies loved as they do.
</charles>

<oliver>	<4%>
	where will the old duke live?
</oliver>

<charles>	<5%>
	they say he is already in the forest of arden, and a many merry men with him; and there they live like the old robin hood of england. they say many young gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the golden world.
</charles>

<oliver>	<5%>
	what, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?
</oliver>

<charles>	<5%>
	marry, do i, sir; and i came to acquaint you with a matter. i am given, sir, secretly to understand that your younger brother orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall. to-morrow, sir, i wrestle for my credit, and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well. your brother is but young and tender; and, for your love, i would be loath to foil him as i must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore, out of my love to you, i came hither to acquaint you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment, or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will.
</charles>

<oliver>	<5%>
	charles, i thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt find i will most kindly requite. i had myself notice of my brother's purpose herein, and have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from it, but he is resolute. i'll tell thee, charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of france; full of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against me his natural brother: therefore use thy discretion. i had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger. and thou wert best look to't; for if thou dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise against thee by poison, entrap thee by some treacherous device, and never leave thee till he hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other; for, i assure thee,—and almost with tears i speak it,—there is not one so young and so villanous this day living. i speak but brotherly of him; but should i anatomize him to thee as he is, i must blush and weep, and thou must look pale and wonder.
</oliver>

<charles>	<6%>
	i am heartily glad i came hither to you. if he come to-morrow, i'll give him his payment: if ever he go alone again, i'll never wrestle for prize more; and so god keep your worship!
</charles>
<stage dir>
<exit.>
</stage dir>

<oliver>	<6%>
	farewell, good charles. now will i stir this gamester. i hope i shall see an end of him; for my soul, yet i know not why, hates nothing more than he. yet he's gentle, never schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of all sorts enchantingly beloved, and, indeed so much in the heart of the world, and especially of my own people, who best know him, that i am altogether misprised. but it shall not be so long; this wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that i kindle the boy thither, which now i'll go about.
</oliver>

<a lawn before the duke's palace.>
<stage dir>
<enter rosalind and celia.>
</stage dir>
<celia>	<7%>
	i pray thee, rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.
</celia>

<rosalind>	<7%>
	dear celia, i show more mirth than i am mistress of, and would you yet i were merrier? unless you could teach me to forget a banished father, you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.
</rosalind>

<celia>	<7%>
	herein i see thou lovest me not with the full weight that i love thee. if my uncle, thy banished father, had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou hadst been still with me, i could have taught my love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou, if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously tempered as mine is to thee.
</celia>

<rosalind>	<7%>
	well, i will forget the condition of my estate, to rejoice in yours.
</rosalind>

<celia>	<7%>
	you know my father hath no child but i, nor none is like to have; and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt be his heir: for what he hath taken away from thy father perforce, i will render thee again in affection; by mine honour, i will; and when i break that oath, let me turn monster. therefore, my sweet rose, my dear rose, be merry.
</celia>

<rosalind>	<8%>
	from henceforth i will, coz, and devise sports. let me see; what think you of falling in love?
</rosalind>

<celia>	<8%>
	marry, i prithee, do, to make sport withal: but love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport neither, than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again.
</celia>

<rosalind>	<8%>
	what shall be our sport then?
</rosalind>

<celia>	<8%>
	let us sit and mock the good housewife fortune from her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.
</celia>

<rosalind>	<8%>
	i would we could do so, for her benefits are mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women.
</rosalind>

<celia>	<8%>
	'tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest, and those that she makes honest she makes very ill-favouredly.
</celia>

<rosalind>	<8%>
	nay, now thou goest from fortune's office to nature's: fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments of nature.

</rosalind>
<stage dir>
<enter touchstone.>
</stage dir>
<celia>	<8%>
	no? when nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by fortune fall into the fire? though nature hath given us wit to flout at fortune, hath not fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?
</celia>

<rosalind>	<8%>
	indeed, there is fortune too hard for nature, when fortune makes nature's natural the cutter-off of nature's wit.
</rosalind>

<celia>	<9%>
	peradventure this is not fortune's work neither, but nature's; who, perceiving our natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses, hath sent this natural for our whetstone: for always the dulness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits. how now, wit! whither wander you?
</celia>

<touchstone>	<9%>
	mistress, you must come away to your father.
</touchstone>

<celia>	<9%>
	were you made the messenger?
</celia>

<touchstone>	<9%>
	no, by mine honour; but i was bid to come for you.
</touchstone>

<rosalind>	<9%>
	where learned you that oath, fool?
</rosalind>

<touchstone>	<9%>
	of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were good pancakes, and swore by his honour the mustard was naught: now, i'll stand to it, the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.
</touchstone>

<celia>	<9%>
	how prove you that, in the great heap of your knowledge?
</celia>

<rosalind>	<9%>
	ay, marry: now unmuzzle your wisdom.
</rosalind>

<touchstone>	<9%>
	stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and swear by your beards that i am a knave.
</touchstone>

<celia>	<9%>
	by our beards, if we had them, thou art.
</celia>

<touchstone>	<9%>
	by my knavery, if i had it, then i were; but if you swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no more was this knight, swearing by his honour, for he never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.
</touchstone>

<celia>	<10%>
	prithee, who is't that thou meanest?
</celia>

<touchstone>	<10%>
	one that old frederick, your father, loves.
</touchstone>

<celia>	<10%>
	my father's love is enough to honour him. enough! speak no more of him; you'll be whipped for taxation one of these days.
</celia>

<touchstone>	<10%>
	the more pity, that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly.
</touchstone>

<celia>	<10%>
	by my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show. here comes monsieur le beau.
</celia>

<rosalind>	<10%>
	with his mouth full of news.
</rosalind>

<celia>	<10%>
	which he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young.
</celia>

<rosalind>	<10%>
	then we shall be news-cramm'd.
</rosalind>

<celia>	<10%>
	all the better; we shall be more marketable.

</celia>
<stage dir>
<enter le beau.>
</stage dir>
	bon jour, monsieur le beau: what's the news?
<le beau>	<10%>
	fair princess, you have lost much good sport.
</le beau>

<celia>	<10%>
	sport! of what colour?
</celia>

<le beau>	<10%>
	what colour, madam! how shall
	i answer you?
</le beau>

<rosalind>	<10%>
	as wit and fortune will.
</rosalind>

<touchstone>	<10%>
	or as the destinies decree.
</touchstone>

<celia>	<10%>
	well said: that was laid on with a trowel.
</celia>

<touchstone>	<10%>
	nay, if i keep not my rank,—
</touchstone>

<rosalind>	<10%>
	thou losest thy old smell.
</rosalind>

<le beau>	<10%>
	you amaze me, ladies: i would have told you of good wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.
</le beau>

<rosalind>	<11%>
	yet tell us the manner of the wrestling.
</rosalind>

<le beau>	<11%>
	i will tell you the beginning; and, if it please your ladyships, you may see the end, for the best is yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming to perform it.
</le beau>

<celia>	<11%>
	well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.
</celia>

<le beau>	<11%>
	there comes an old man and his three sons,—
</le beau>

<celia>	<11%>
	i could match this beginning with an old tale.
</celia>

<le beau>	<11%>
	three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence;—
</le beau>

<rosalind>	<11%>
	with bills on their necks, 'be it known unto all men by these presents.'
</rosalind>

<le beau>	<11%>
	the eldest of the three wrestled with charles, the duke's wrestler; which charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs, that there is little hope of life in him: so he served the second, and so the third. yonder they lie; the poor old man, their father, making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping.
</le beau>

<rosalind>	<11%>
	alas!
</rosalind>

<touchstone>	<11%>
	but what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have lost?
</touchstone>

<le beau>	<11%>
	why, this that i speak of.
</le beau>

<touchstone>	<11%>
	thus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first time that ever i heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies.
</touchstone>

<celia>	<11%>
	or i, i promise thee.
</celia>

<rosalind>	<11%>
	but is there any else longs to feel this broken music in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking? shall we see this wrestling, cousin?
</rosalind>

<le beau>	<12%>
	you must, if you stay here; for here is the place appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to perform it.
</le beau>

<celia>	<12%>
	yonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it.

</rosalind>

<le beau>	<12%>
	even he, madam.
</le beau>

<celia>	<12%>
	alas! he is too young: yet he looks successfully.
</celia>

<duke f>	<12%>
	how now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither to see the wrestling?
</duke f>

<rosalind>	<12%>
	ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.
</rosalind>

<duke f>	<12%>
	you will take little delight in it, i can tell you, there is such odds in the man: in pity of the challenger's youth i would fam dissuade him, but he will not be entreated. speak to him, ladies; see if you can move him.

<celia>	<12%>

<rosalind>	<13%>
	young man, have you challenged charles the wrestler?
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<13%>
	no, fair princess; he is the general challenger: i come but in, as others do, to try with him the strength of my youth.
</orlando>

<celia>	<13%>
	young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years. you have seen cruel proof of this man's strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise. we pray you, for your own sake, to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.
</celia>

<rosalind>	<13%>
	do, young sir: your reputation shall not therefore be misprised. we will make it our suit to the duke that the wrestling might not go forward.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<13%>
	i beseech you, punish me not with your hard thoughts, wherein i confess me much guilty, to deny so fair and excellent ladies anything. but let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial: wherein if i be foiled, there is but one shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one dead that is willing to be so. i shall do my friends no wrong, for i have none to lament me; the world no injury, for in it i have nothing; only in the world i fill up a place, which may be better supplied when i have made it empty.
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<13%>
	the little strength that i have, i would it were with you.
</rosalind>

<celia>	<14%>
	and mine, to eke out hers.
</celia>

<rosalind>	<14%>
	fare you well. pray heaven i be deceived in you!
</rosalind>

<celia>	<14%>
	your heart's desires be with you!
</celia>

<charles>	<14%>
	come, where is this young gallant that is so desirous to lie with his mother earth?
</charles>

<orlando>	<14%>
	ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.
</orlando>

<duke f>	<14%>
	you shall try but one fall.
</duke f>

<charles>	<14%>
	no, i warrant your grace, you shall not entreat him to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him from a first.
</charles>

<orlando>	<14%>
	you mean to mock me after; you should not have mocked me before: but come your ways.
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<14%>

</orlando>

<rosalind>	<15%>
	my father lov'd sir rowland as his soul,

	good sir, i do in friendship counsel you
	to leave this place. albeit you have deserv'd
	high commendation, true applause and love,
	yet such is now the duke's condition
	that he misconstrues all that you have done.
	the duke is humorous: what he is indeed,
	more suits you to conceive than i to speak of.
</le beau>

<orlando>	<16%>
	i thank you, sir; and pray you, tell me this;
	which of the two was daughter of the duke,
	that here was at the wrestling?
</orlando>

<le beau>	<16%>
	neither his daughter, if we judge by manners:
	but yet, indeed the smaller is his daughter:
	the other is daughter to the banish'd duke,
	and here detain'd by her usurping uncle,
	to keep his daughter company; whose loves
	are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.
	but i can tell you that of late this duke
	hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,
	grounded upon no other argument
	but that the people praise her for her virtues,
	and pity her for her good father's sake;
	and, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady
	will suddenly break forth. sir, fare you well:
	hereafter, in a better world than this,
	i shall desire more love and knowledge of you.
</le beau>

</rosalind>

<duke f>	<19%>
	you, cousin:
	within these ten days if that thou be'st found
	so near our public court as twenty miles,
	thou diest for it.
</duke f>

<rosalind>	<19%>
	i do beseech your grace,
	let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me.
	if with myself i hold intelligence,
	or have acquaintance with mine own desires,
	if that i do not dream or be not frantic,—
	as i do trust i am not,—then, dear uncle,
	never so much as in a thought unborn
	did i offend your highness.
</rosalind>

<duke f>	<19%>
	thus do all traitors:
	if their purgation did consist in words,
	they are as innocent as grace itself:
	let it suffice thee that i trust thee not.
</duke f>

<rosalind>	<19%>
	yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor:
	tell me whereon the likelihood depends.
</rosalind>

<duke f>	<19%>
	thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.
</duke f>

<rosalind>	<19%>
	so was i when your highness took his dukedom;
	so was i when your highness banish'd him.
	treason is not inherited, my lord;
	or, if we did derive it from our friends,
	what's that to me? my father was no traitor:
	then, good my liege, mistake me not so much
	to think my poverty is treacherous.
</rosalind>

<celia>	<19%>
	dear sovereign, hear me speak.
</celia>

<duke f>	<19%>
	ay, celia; we stay'd her for your sake;
	else had she with her father rang'd along.
</duke f>

<celia>	<20%>
	i did not then entreat to have her stay:
	it was your pleasure and your own remorse.
	i was too young that time to value her;
	but now i know her: if she be a traitor,
	why so am i; we still have slept together,
	rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together;
	and wheresoe'er we went, like juno's swans,
	still we went coupled and inseparable.
</celia>

<duke f>	<20%>
	she is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,
	her very silence and her patience,
	speak to the people, and they pity her.
	thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name;
	and thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
	when she is gone. then open not thy lips:
	firm and irrevocable is my doom
	which i have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.
</duke f>

<celia>	<20%>
	pronounce that sentence then, on me, my liege:
	i cannot live out of her company.
</celia>

<duke f>	<20%>

</celia>

<rosalind>	<20%>
	i have more cause.
</rosalind>

<celia>	<20%>
	thou hast not, cousin;

	hath banish'd me, his daughter?
</celia>

<rosalind>	<21%>
	that he hath not.
</rosalind>

<celia>	<21%>
	no, hath not? rosalind lacks then the love
	which teacheth thee that thou and i am one:
	shall we be sunder'd? shall we part, sweet girl?
	no: let my father seek another heir.
	therefore devise with me how we may fly,
	whither to go, and what to bear with us:
	and do not seek to take your change upon you,
	to bear your griefs yourself and leave me out;
	for, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,
	say what thou canst, i'll go along with thee.
</celia>

<rosalind>	<21%>
	why, whither shall we go?
</rosalind>

<celia>	<21%>
	to seek my uncle in the forest of arden.
</celia>

<rosalind>	<21%>
	alas, what danger will it be to us,
	maids as we are, to travel forth so far!
	beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.
</rosalind>

<celia>	<21%>
	i'll put myself in poor and mean attire,
	and with a kind of umber smirch my face;
	the like do you: so shall we pass along
	and never stir assailants.
</celia>

<rosalind>	<21%>
	were it not better,
	because that i am more than common tall,
	that i did suit me all points like a man?
	a gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,
	a boar-spear in my hand; and,—in my heart
	lie there what hidden woman's fear there will,—
	we'll have a swashing and a martial outside,
	as many other mannish cowards have
	that do outface it with their semblances.
</rosalind>

<celia>	<22%>
	what shall i call thee when thou art a man?
</celia>

<rosalind>	<22%>
	i'll have no worse a name than jove's own page,
	and therefore look you call me ganymede.
	but what will you be call'd?
</rosalind>

<celia>	<22%>
	something that hath a reference to my state:
	no longer celia, but aliena.
</celia>

<rosalind>	<22%>
	but, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal
	the clownish fool out of your father's court?
	would he not be a comfort to our travel?
</rosalind>

<celia>	<22%>
	he'll go along o'er the wide world with me;
	leave me alone to woo him. let's away,
	and get our jewels and our wealth together,
	devise the fittest time and safest way
	to hide us from pursuit that will be made
	after my flight. now go we in content

<enter duke senior, amiens, and other lords, like foresters.>
</stage dir>
<duke s>	<22%>
	now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,
	hath not old custom made this life more sweet
	than that of painted pomp? are not these woods
	more free from peril than the envious court?
	here feel we but the penalty of adam,
	the seasons' difference; as, the icy fang
	and churlish chiding of the winter's wind,
	which, when it bites and blows upon my body,
	even till i shrink with cold, i smile and say
	'this is no flattery: these are counsellors
	that feelingly persuade me what i am.'
	sweet are the uses of adversity,
	which like the toad, ugly and venomous,
	wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
	and this our life exempt from public haunt,
	finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
	sermons in stones, and good in every thing.
	i would not change it.
</duke s>

<amiens>	<23%>
	happy is your grace,
	that can translate the stubbornness of fortune
	into so quiet and so sweet a style.
</amiens>

<duke s>	<23%>
	come, shall we go and kill us venison?
	and yet it irks me, the poor dappled fools,
	being native burghers of this desert city,
	should in their own confines with forked heads
	have their round haunches gor'd.
</duke s>

<lord 1>	<23%>
	indeed, my lord,
	the melancholy jaques grieves at that;
	and, in that kind, swears you do more usurp
	than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.
	to-day my lord of amiens and myself
	did steal behind him as he lay along
	under an oak whose antique root peeps out
	upon the brook that brawls along this wood;
	to the which place a poor sequester'd stag,
	that from the hunters' aim had ta'en a hurt,
	did come to languish; and, indeed, my lord,
	the wretched animal heav'd forth such groans
	that their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
	almost to bursting, and the big round tears
	cours'd one another down his innocent nose
	in piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool,
	much marked of the melancholy jaques,
	stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,
	augmenting it with tears.
</lord 1>

<duke s>	<24%>
	but what said jaques?
	did he not moralize this spectacle?
</duke s>

<lord 1>	<24%>
	o, yes, into a thousand similes.
	first, for his weeping into the needless stream;
	'poor deer,' quoth he, 'thou mak'st a testament
	as worldlings do, giving thy sum of more
	to that which had too much:' then, being there alone,
	left and abandon'd of his velvet friends;
	''tis right,' quoth he; 'thus misery doth part
	the flux of company:' anon, a careless herd,
	full of the pasture, jumps along by him
	and never stays to greet him; 'ay,' quoth jaques,
	'sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;
	'tis just the fashion; wherefore do you look
	upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'
	thus most invectively he pierceth through
	the body of the country, city, court,
	yea, and of this our life; swearing that we
	are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what's worse,
	to fright the animals and to kill them up
	in their assign'd and native dwelling-place.
</lord 1>

<duke s>	<24%>
	and did you leave him in this contemplation?
</duke s>

<lord 2>	<25%>
	we did, my lord, weeping and commenting
	upon the sobbing deer.
</lord 2>

<duke s>	<25%>
	show me the place.
	i love to cope him in these sullen fits,
	for then he's full of matter.

	why are you virtuous? why do people love you?
	and wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant?
	why would you be so fond to overcome
	the bony priser of the humorous duke?
	your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
	know you not, master, to some kind of men
	their graces serve them but as enemies?
	no more do yours: your virtues, gentle master,
	are sanctified and holy traitors to you.
	o, what a world is this, when what is comely
	envenoms him that bears it!
</adam>

<orlando>	<26%>
	why, what's the matter?

	o unhappy youth!
	come not within these doors; within this roof

	your brother,—no, no brother; yet the son,—
	yet not the son, i will not call him son
	of him i was about to call his father,—
	hath heard your praises, and this night he means
	to burn the lodging where you use to lie,
	and you within it: if he fail of that,
	he will have other means to cut you off.
	i overheard him and his practices.
	this is no place; this house is but a butchery:
	abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.
</adam>

<orlando>	<27%>
	why, whither, adam, wouldst thou have me go?
</orlando>

<adam>	<27%>
	no matter whither, so you come not here.
</adam>

<orlando>	<27%>
	what! wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?
	or with a base and boisterous sword enforce
	a thievish living on the common road?
	this i must do, or know not what to do:
	yet this i will not do, do how i can;
	i rather will subject me to the malice
	of a diverted blood and bloody brother.
</orlando>

<adam>	<27%>
	but do not so. i have five hundred crowns,
	the thrifty hire i sav'd under your father,
	which i did store to be my foster-nurse
	when service should in my old limbs lie lame,
	and unregarded age in corners thrown.
	take that; and he that doth the ravens feed,
	yea, providently caters for the sparrow,
	be comfort to my age! here is the gold;
	all this i give you. let me be your servant:
	though i look old, yet i am strong and lusty;
	for in my youth i never did apply
	hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,
	nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
	the means of weakness and debility;
	therefore my age is as a lusty winter,
	frosty, but kindly. let me go with you;
	i'll do the service of a younger man
	in all your business and necessities.
</adam>

<orlando>	<27%>
	o good old man! how well in thee appears
	the constant service of the antique world,
	when service sweat for duty, not for meed!
	thou art not for the fashion of these times,
	where none will sweat but for promotion,
	and having that, do choke their service up
	even with the having: it is not so with thee.
	but, poor old man, thou prun'st a rotten tree,
	that cannot so much as a blossom yield,
	in lieu of all thy pains and husbandry.
	but come thy ways, we'll go along together,
	and ere we have thy youthful wages spent,
	we'll light upon some settled low content.
</orlando>

<adam>	<28%>
	master, go on, and i will follow thee
	to the last gasp with truth and loyalty.
	from seventeen years till now almost fourscore
	here lived i, but now live here no more.
	at seventeen years many their fortunes seek;
	but at fourscore it is too late a week:
	yet fortune cannot recompense me better
	than to die well and not my master's debtor.

	my fortunes were more able to relieve her;

	my master is of churlish disposition
	and little recks to find the way to heaven
	by doing deeds of hospitality.
	besides, his cote, his flocks, and bounds of feed
	are now on sale; and at our sheepcote now,
	by reason of his absence, there is nothing

	a fool, a fool! i met a fool i' the forest,
	a motley fool; a miserable world!
	as i do live by food, i met a fool;
	who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,
	and rail'd on lady fortune in good terms,
	in good set terms, and yet a motley fool.
	'good morrow, fool,' quoth i. 'no, sir,' quoth he,
	'call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune.'
	and then he drew a dial from his poke,
	and, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,
	says very wisely, 'it is ten o'clock;
	thus may we see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags:
	'tis but an hour ago since it was nine,
	and after one hour more 'twill be eleven;
	and so, from hour to hour we ripe and ripe,
	and then from hour to hour we rot and rot,
	and thereby hangs a tale.' when i did hear
	the motley fool thus moral on the time,
	my lungs began to crow like chanticleer,
	that fools should be so deep-contemplative,
	and i did laugh sans intermission
	an hour by his dial. o noble fool!
	a worthy fool! motley's the only wear.
</jaques>

<duke s>	<36%>
	what fool is this?
</duke s>

<jaques>	<36%>
	o worthy fool! one that hath been a courtier,
	and says, if ladies be but young and fair,
	they have the gift to know it; and in his brain,—
	which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
	after a voyage,—he hath strange places cramm'd
	with observation, the which he vents
	in mangled forms. o that i were a fool!
	i am ambitious for a motley coat.
</jaques>

<duke s>	<36%>
	thou shalt have one.
</duke s>

<jaques>	<36%>
	it is my only suit;
	provided that you weed your better judgments
	of all opinion that grows rank in them
	that i am wise. i must have liberty
	withal, as large a charter as the wind,
	to blow on whom i please; for so fools have:
	and they that are most galled with my folly,
	they most must laugh. and why, sir, must they so?
	the 'why' is plain as way to parish church:
	he that a fool doth very wisely hit
	doth very foolishly, although he smart,
	not to seem senseless of the bob; if not,
	the wise man's folly is anatomiz'd
	even by the squandering glances of the fool.
	invest me in my motley; give me leave
	to speak my mind, and i will through and through
	cleanse the foul body of th' infected world,
	if they will patiently receive my medicine.

	wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.

<jaques>	<37%>
	why, who cries out on pride,
	that can therein tax any private party?
	doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,
	till that the weary very means do ebb?
	what woman in the city do i name,
	when that i say the city-woman bears
	the cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
	who can come in and say that i mean her,
	when such a one as she such is her neighbour?
	or what is he of basest function,
	that says his bravery is not on my cost,—
	thinking that i mean him,—but therein suits
	his folly to the mettle of my speech?
	there then; how then? what then? let me see wherein
	my tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,

	and then the whining school-boy, with his satchel,
	and shining morning face, creeping like snail
	unwillingly to school. and then the lover,
	sighing like furnace, with a woful ballad
	made to his mistress' eyebrow. then a soldier,
	full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
	jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
	seeking the bubble reputation
	even in the cannon's mouth. and then the justice,
	in fair round belly with good capon lin'd,
	with eyes severe, and beard of formal cut,
	full of wise saws and modern instances;
	and so he plays his part. the sixth age shifts
	into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
	with spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
	his youthful hose well sav'd, a world too wide
	for his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
	turning again toward childish treble, pipes
	and whistles in his sound. last scene of all,

	is second childishness and mere oblivion,
	sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

</touchstone>

<corin>	<44%>
	no more but that i know the more one sickens the worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money, means, and content, is without three good friends; that the property of rain is to wet, and fire to burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding, or comes of a very dull kindred.

	not a whit, touchstone: those that are good manners at the court, are as ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the country is most mockable at the court. you told me you salute not at the court, but you kiss your hands; that courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.

	here comes my sister, reading: stand aside.
</rosalind>

<celia>	<47%>

	why should this a desert be?
	for it is unpeopled? no;
	tongues i'll hang on every tree,
	that shall civil sayings show.
	some, how brief the life of man
	runs his erring pilgrimage,
	that the stretching of a span
	buckles in his sum of age;
	some, of violated vows
	'twixt the souls of friend and friend:
	but upon the fairest boughs,
	or at every sentence' end,
	will i rosalinda write;
	teaching all that read to know
	the quintessence of every sprite
	heaven would in little show.
	therefore heaven nature charg'd
	that one body should be fill'd
	with all graces wide enlarg'd:
	nature presently distill'd
	helen's cheek, but not her heart,
	cleopatra's majesty,
	atalanta's better part,
	sad lucretia's modesty.
	thus rosalind of many parts
	by heavenly synod was devis'd
	of many faces, eyes, and hearts,
	to have the touches dearest priz'd.
	heaven would that she these gifts should have,
	and i to live and die her slave.

	o most gentle pulpiter! what tedious homily of love have you wearied your parishioners withal, and never cried, 'have patience, good people!'
</rosalind>

<celia>	<48%>
	how now! back, friends! shepherd, go off a little: go with him, sirrah.

<celia>	<48%>
	didst thou hear these verses?
</celia>

<rosalind>	<48%>
	o, yes, i heard them all, and more too; for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.
</rosalind>

<celia>	<48%>
	that's no matter: the feet might bear the verses.
</celia>

<rosalind>	<48%>
	ay, but the feet were lame, and could not bear themselves without the verse, and therefore stood lamely in the verse.
</rosalind>

<celia>	<48%>
	but didst thou hear without wondering, how thy name should be hanged and carved upon these trees?
</celia>

<rosalind>	<48%>
	i was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you came; for look here what i found on a palm-tree: i was never so be-rimed since pythagoras' time, that i was an irish rat, which i can hardly remember.
</rosalind>

<celia>	<49%>
	trow you who hath done this?
</celia>

<rosalind>	<49%>
	is it a man?

	and a chain, that you once wore, about his neck. change you colour?
</celia>

<rosalind>	<49%>
	i prithee, who?
</rosalind>

<celia>	<49%>
	o lord, lord! it is a hard matter for friends to meet; but mountains may be removed with earthquakes, and so encounter.
</celia>

<rosalind>	<49%>
	nay, but who is it?
</rosalind>

<celia>	<49%>
	is it possible?
</celia>

<rosalind>	<49%>
	nay, i prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence, tell me who it is.
</rosalind>

<celia>	<49%>
	o wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful wonderful! and yet again wonderful! and after that, out of all whooping!
</celia>

<rosalind>	<49%>
	good my complexion! dost thou think, though i am caparison'd like a man, i have a doublet and hose in my disposition? one inch of delay more is a south-sea of discovery; i prithee, tell me who is it quickly, and speak apace. i would thou couldst stammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of a narrow-mouth'd bottle; either too much at once, or none at all. i prithee, take the cork out of thy mouth, that i may drink thy tidings.
</rosalind>

<celia>	<49%>
	so you may put a man in your belly.
</celia>

<rosalind>	<49%>
	is he of god's making? what manner of man? is his head worth a hat, or his chin worth a beard?
</rosalind>

<celia>	<49%>
	nay, he hath but a little beard.
</celia>

<rosalind>	<49%>
	why, god will send more, if the man will be thankful. let me stay the growth of his beard, if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.
</rosalind>

	orlando?
</rosalind>

<celia>	<50%>
	orlando.
</celia>

<rosalind>	<50%>
	alas the day! what shall i do with my doublet and hose? what did he when thou sawest him? what said he? how looked he? wherein went he? what makes he here? did he ask for me? where remains he? how parted he with thee, and when shalt thou see him again? answer me in one word.
</rosalind>

<celia>	<50%>
	you must borrow me gargantua's mouth first: 'tis a word too great for any mouth of this age's size. to say ay and no to these particulars is more than to answer in a catechism.
</celia>

<rosalind>	<50%>
	but doth he know that i am in this forest and in man's apparel? looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled?
</rosalind>

<celia>	<50%>
	it is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my finding him, and relish it with good observance. i found him under a tree, like a dropped acorn.
</celia>

<rosalind>	<50%>
	it may well be called jove's tree, when it drops forth such fruit.
</rosalind>

<celia>	<50%>
	give me audience, good madam.
</celia>

<rosalind>	<51%>
	proceed.
</rosalind>

<celia>	<51%>
	there lay he, stretch'd along like a wounded knight.
</celia>

	though it be pity to see such a sight, it well becomes the ground.
</rosalind>

<celia>	<51%>
	cry 'holla!' to thy tongue, i prithee; it curvets unseasonably. he was furnish'd like a hunter.
</celia>

<rosalind>	<51%>
	o, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.
</rosalind>

<celia>	<51%>
	i would sing my song without a burthen: thou bringest me out of tune.
</celia>

<rosalind>	<51%>
	do you not know i am a woman? when i think, i must speak. sweet, say on.
</rosalind>

<celia>	<51%>

	i thank you for your company; but, good faith, i had as lief have been myself alone.
</jaques>

<orlando>	<51%>
	and so had i; but yet, for fashion' sake, i thank you too for your society.
</orlando>

<jaques>	<51%>
	god be wi' you: let's meet as little as we can.
</jaques>

<orlando>	<51%>
	i do desire we may be better strangers.
</orlando>

<jaques>	<51%>
	i pray you, mar no more trees with writing love-songs in their barks.
</jaques>

<orlando>	<51%>
	i pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them ill-favouredly.
</orlando>

<jaques>	<51%>
	rosalind is your love's name?
</jaques>

<orlando>	<51%>
	yes, just.
</orlando>

<jaques>	<51%>
	i do not like her name.
</jaques>

<orlando>	<51%>
	there was no thought of pleasing you when she was christened.
</orlando>

<jaques>	<51%>
	what stature is she of?
</jaques>

<orlando>	<52%>
	just as high as my heart.
</orlando>

<jaques>	<52%>
	you are full of pretty answers. have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conn'd them out of rings?
</jaques>

<orlando>	<52%>
	not so; but i answer you right painted cloth, from whence you have studied your questions.
</orlando>

<jaques>	<52%>
	you have a nimble wit: i think 'twas made of atalanta's heels. will you sit down with me? and we two will rail against our mistress the world, and all our misery.
</jaques>

<orlando>	<52%>
	i will chide no breather in the world but myself, against whom i know most faults.
</orlando>

<jaques>	<52%>
	the worst fault you have is to be in love.
</jaques>

<orlando>	<52%>
	'tis a fault i will not change for your best virtue. i am weary of you.
</orlando>

<jaques>	<52%>
	by my troth, i was seeking for a fool when i found you.
</jaques>

<orlando>	<52%>
	he is drowned in the brook: look but in, and you shall see him.
</orlando>

<jaques>	<52%>
	there i shall see mine own figure.
</jaques>

<orlando>	<52%>
	which i take to be either a fool or a cipher.
</orlando>

<jaques>	<52%>
	i'll tarry no longer with you. farewell, good signior love.

<orlando>	<52%>
	i am glad of your departure. adieu, good monsieur melancholy.
</orlando>
<stage dir>
<exit jaques.>

<rosalind>	<52%>
	i will speak to him like a saucy lackey, and under that habit play the knave with him. do you hear, forester?
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<52%>
	very well: what would you?
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<52%>
	i pray you, what is't o'clock?
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<53%>
	you should ask me, what time o' day; there's no clock in the forest.
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<53%>
	then there is no true lover in the forest; else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<53%>
	and why not the swift foot of time? had not that been as proper?
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<53%>
	by no means, sir. time travels in divers paces with divers persons. i'll tell you who time ambles withal, who time trots withal, who time gallops withal, and who he stands still withal.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<53%>
	i prithee, who doth he trot withal?
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<53%>
	marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnized; if the interim be but a se'nnight, time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<53%>
	who ambles time withal?
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<53%>
	with a priest that lacks latin, and a rich man that hath not the gout; for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain; the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury. these time ambles withal.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<53%>
	who doth he gallop withal?
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<53%>
	with a thief to the gallows; for though he go as softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<54%>
	who stays it still withal?
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<54%>
	with lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep between term and term, and then they perceive not how time moves.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<54%>
	where dwell you, pretty youth?
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<54%>
	with this shepherdess, my sister; here in the skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<54%>
	are you native of this place?
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<54%>
	as the cony, that you see dwell where she is kindled.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<54%>
	your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling.
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<54%>
	i have been told so of many: but indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship too well, for there he fell in love. i have heard him read many lectures against it; and i thank god, i am not a woman, to be touched with so many giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<54%>
	can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women?
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<54%>
	there were none principal; they were all like one another as half-pence are; every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<54%>
	i prithee, recount some of them.
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<54%>
	no, i will not cast away my physic, but on those that are sick. there is a man haunts the forest, that abuses our young plants with carving 'rosalind' on their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns, and elegies on brambles; all, forsooth, deifying the name of rosalind: if i could meet that fancy-monger, i would give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<55%>
	i am he that is so love-shaked. i pray you, tell me your remedy.
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<55%>
	there is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage of rushes i am sure you are not prisoner.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<55%>
	what were his marks?
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<55%>
	a lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken, which you have not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not; a beard neglected, which you have not: but i pardon you for that, for, simply, your having in beard is a younger brother's revenue. then, your hose should be ungartered, your bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe untied, and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation. but you are no such man: you are rather point-device in your accoutrements; as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<55%>
	fair youth, i would i could make thee believe i love.
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<55%>
	me believe it! you may as soon make her that you love believe it; which, i warrant, she is apter to do than to confess she does; that is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences. but, in good sooth, are you he that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein rosalind is so admired?
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<56%>
	i swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of rosalind, i am that he, that unfortunate he.
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<56%>
	but are you so much in love as your rimes speak?
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<56%>
	neither rime nor reason can express how much.
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<56%>
	love is merely a madness, and, i tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do; and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too. yet i profess curing it by counsel.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<56%>
	did you ever cure any so?
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<56%>
	yes, one; and in this manner. he was to imagine me his love, his mistress; and i set him every day to woo me: at which time would i, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing and liking; proud, fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every passion something, and for no passion truly anything, as boys and women are, for the most part, cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep for him, then spit at him; that i drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of madness, which was, to forswear the full stream of the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic. and thus i cured him; and this way will i take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<57%>
	i would not be cured, youth.
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<57%>
	i would cure you, if you would but call me rosalind, and come every day to my cote and woo me.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<57%>
	now, by the faith of my love, i will: tell me where it is.
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<57%>
	go with me to it and i'll show it you; and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live. will you go?
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<57%>
	with all my heart, good youth.
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<57%>
	nay, you must call me rosalind. come, sister, will you go?

	i do not know what 'poetical' is. is it honest in deed and word? is it a true thing?

<celia>	<62%>
	o, that's a brave man! he writes brave verses, speaks brave words, swears brave oaths, and breaks them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of his lover; as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horse but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble goose. but all's brave that youth mounts and folly guides. who comes here?

	sweet phebe, do not scorn me; do not, phebe:
	say that you love me not, but say not so
	in bitterness. the common executioner,
	whose heart the accustom'd sight of death makes hard,
	falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
	but first begs pardon: will you sterner be

	i would not be thy executioner:
	i fly thee, for i would not injure thee.
	thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye:
	'tis pretty, sure, and very probable,
	that eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,
	who shut their coward gates on atomies,
	should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!
	now i do frown on thee with all my heart;
	and, if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee;
	now counterfeit to swound; why now fall down;
	or, if thou canst not, o! for shame, for shame,
	lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers.
	now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee;
	scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
	some scar of it; lean but upon a rush,
	the cicatrice and capable impressure
	thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,
	which i have darted at thee, hurt thee not,
	nor, i am sure, there is no force in eyes
	that can do hurt.
</phebe>

<silvius>	<64%>
	o dear phebe,
	if ever,—as that ever may be near,—
	you meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,
	then shall you know the wounds invisible
	that love's keen arrows make.
</silvius>

<phebe>	<64%>
	but, till that time
	come not thou near me; and, when that time comes,
	afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;
	as, till that time i shall not pity thee.
</phebe>

<rosalind>	<64%>
<stage dir>
<advancing.>
</stage dir> and why, i pray you? who might be your mother,
	that you insult, exult, and all at once,
	over the wretched? what though you have no beauty,—
	as by my faith, i see no more in you
	than without candle may go dark to bed,—
	must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
	why, what means this? why do you look on me?
	i see no more in you than in the ordinary
	of nature's sale-work. od's my little life!
	i think she means to tangle my eyes too.
	no, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it:
	'tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,
	your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,
	that can entame my spirits to your worship.
	you foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,
	like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?
	you are a thousand times a properer man
	than she a woman: 'tis such fools as you
	that make the world full of ill-favour'd children:
	'tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;
	and out of you she sees herself more proper
	than any of her lineaments can show her.
	but, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,
	and thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love:
	for i must tell you friendly in your ear,
	sell when you can; you are not for all markets.
	cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer:
	foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.
	so take her to thee, shepherd. fare you well.

	sweet youth, i pray you, chide a year together:
	i had rather hear you chide than this man woo.

	he's fallen in love with her foulness, and she'll fall in love with my anger. if it be so, as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks, i'll sauce her with bitter words. why look you so upon me?

<rosalind>	<66%>
	i pray you, do not fall in love with me,

	'tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.
	will you go, sister? shepherd, ply her hard.
	come, sister. shepherdess, look on him better,

</phebe>

<silvius>	<66%>
	wherever sorrow is, relief would be:

</phebe>

<silvius>	<66%>
	i would have you.
</silvius>

<phebe>	<66%>
	why, that were covetousness.
	silvius, the time was that i hated thee;
	and yet it is not that i bear thee love:
	but since that thou canst talk of love so well,
	thy company, which erst was irksome to me,
	i will endure, and i'll employ thee too;
	but do not look for further recompense
	than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.
</phebe>

<silvius>	<67%>
	so holy and so perfect is my love,
	and i in such a poverty of grace,
	that i shall think it a most plenteous crop
	to glean the broken ears after the man
	that the main harvest reaps: loose now and then
	a scatter'd smile, and that i'll live upon.
</silvius>

<phebe>	<67%>
	know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
</phebe>

<silvius>	<67%>
	not very well, but i have met him oft;
	and he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
	that the old carlot once was master of.
</silvius>

<phebe>	<67%>
	think not i love him, though i ask for him.
	'tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well;
	but what care i for words? yet words do well,
	when he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
	it is a pretty youth: not very pretty:
	but, sure, he's proud; and yet his pride becomes him:
	he'll make a proper man: the best thing in him
	is his complexion; and faster than his tongue
	did make offence his eye did heal it up.
	he is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall:
	his leg is but so so; and yet 'tis well:
	there was a pretty redness in his lip,
	a little riper and more lusty red
	than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference
	betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.
	there be some women, silvius, had they mark'd him
	in parcels as i did, would have gone near
	to fall in love with him; but, for my part,
	i love him not nor hate him not; and yet
	have more cause to hate him than to love him:
	for what had he to do to chide at me?
	he said mine eyes were black and my hair black;
	and, now i am remember'd, scorn'd at me.
	i marvel why i answer'd not again:
	but that's all one; omittance is no quittance.
	i'll write to him a very taunting letter,
	and thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, silvius?
</phebe>

<silvius>	<68%>
	phebe, with all my heart.
</silvius>

<phebe>	<68%>
	i'll write it straight;
	the matter's in my head and in my heart:
	i will be bitter with him and passing short.
	go with me, silvius.

</jaques>

<rosalind>	<69%>
	a traveller! by my faith, you have great reason to be sad. i fear you have sold your own lands to see other men's; then, to have seen much and to have nothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands.

<orlando>	<70%>
	pardon me, dear rosalind.

	what's that?

</rosalind>

<orlando>	<71%>
	i would kiss before i spoke.
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<71%>
	nay, you were better speak first, and when you were gravelled for lack of matter, you might take occasion to kiss. very good orators, when they are out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking,—god warn us!—matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<71%>
	how if the kiss be denied?
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<71%>

<orlando>	<71%>
	who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<71%>
	marry, that should you, if i were your mistress; or i should think my honesty ranker than my wit.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<71%>
	what, of my suit?
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<71%>
	not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit. am not i your rosalind?
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<71%>
	i take some joy to say you are, because i would be talking of her.
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<71%>
	well, in her person i say i will not have you.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<71%>
	then in mine own person i die.
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<71%>
	no, faith, die by attorney. the poor world is almost six thousand years old, and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person, videlicet, in a love-cause. troilus had his brains dashed out with a grecian club; yet he did what he could to die before, and he is one of the patterns of love. leander, he would have lived many a fair year, though hero had turned nun, if it had not been for a hot mid-summer night; for, good youth, he went but forth to wash him in the hellespont, and being taken with the cramp was drowned; and the foolish coroners of that age found it was 'hero of sestos.' but these are all lies: men have died from time to time, and worms have eaten them, but not for love.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<72%>
	i would not have my right rosalind of this mind; for, i protest, her frown might kill me.
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<72%>
	by this hand, it will not kill a fly. but come, now i will be your rosalind in a more coming-on disposition; and ask me what you will, i will grant it.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<72%>
	then love me, rosalind.
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<72%>
	yes, faith will i, fridays and saturdays and all.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<72%>
	and wilt thou have me?
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<72%>
	ay, and twenty such.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<72%>
	what sayest thou?
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<72%>
	are you not good?
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<72%>
	i hope so.
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<72%>
	why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?—come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.—give me your hand, orlando. what do you say, sister?
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<72%>
	pray thee, marry us.
</orlando>

<celia>	<72%>
	i cannot say the words.
</celia>

<rosalind>	<72%>
	you must begin,—'will you, orlando,'—
</rosalind>

<celia>	<72%>
	go to.—will you, orlando, have to wife this rosalind?
</celia>

<orlando>	<73%>
	i will.
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<73%>
	ay, but when?
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<73%>
	why now; as fast as she can marry us.
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<73%>
	then you must say, 'i take thee, rosalind, for wife.'
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<73%>
	i take thee, rosalind, for wife.
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<73%>
	i might ask you for your commission; but, i do take thee, orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goes before the priest; and, certainly, a woman's thought runs before her actions.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<73%>
	so do all thoughts; they are winged.
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<73%>
	now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her?
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<73%>
	for ever and a day.
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<73%>
	say 'a day,' without the 'ever.' no, no, orlando; men are april when they woo, december when they wed: maids are may when they are maids, but the sky changes when they are wives. i will be more jealous of thee than a barbary cock-pigeon over his hen; more clamorous than a parrot against rain; more new-fangled than an ape; more giddy in my desires than a monkey: i will weep for nothing, like diana in the fountain, and i will do that when you are disposed to be merry; i will laugh like a hyen, and that when thou art inclined to sleep.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<73%>
	but will my rosalind do so?
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<73%>
	by my life, she will do as i do.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<73%>
	o! but she is wise.
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<73%>
	or else she could not have the wit to do this: the wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman's wit, and it will out at the casement; shut that, and 'twill out at the key-hole; stop that, 'twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<74%>
	a man that hath a wife with such a wit, he might say, 'wit, whither wilt?'
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<74%>
	nay, you might keep that check for it till you met your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<74%>
	and what wit could wit have to excuse that?
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<74%>
	marry, to say she came to seek you there. you shall never take her without her answer, unless you take her without her tongue. o! that woman that cannot make her fault her husband's occasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for she will breed it like a fool.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<74%>
	for these two hours, rosalind, i will leave thee.
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<74%>
	alas! dear love, i cannot lack thee two hours.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<74%>
	i must attend the duke at dinner: by two o'clock i will be with thee again.
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<74%>
	ay, go your ways, go your ways; i knew what you would prove, my friends told me as much, and i thought no less: that flattering tongue of yours won me: 'tis but one cast away, and so, come, death! two o'clock is your hour?
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<74%>
	ay, sweet rosalind.
</orlando>

<rosalind>	<74%>
	by my troth, and in good earnest, and so god mend me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour, i will think you the most pathetical break-promise, and the most hollow lover, and the most unworthy of her you call rosalind, that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful. therefore, beware my censure, and keep your promise.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<75%>
	with no less religion than if thou wert indeed my rosalind: so, adieu.

	whiles the eye of man did woo me,
	that could do no vengeance to me.

	meaning me a beast.

	if the scorn of your bright eyne
	have power to raise such love in mine,
	alack! in me what strange effect
	would they work in mild aspect.
	whiles you chid me, i did love,
	how then might your prayers move!
	he that brings this love to thee
	little knows this love in me;
	and by him seal up thy mind;
	whether that thy youth and kind
	will the faithful offer take
	of me and all that i can make;
	or else by him my love deny,
	and then i'll study how to die.

<oliver>	<80%>
	when last the young orlando parted from you
	he left a promise to return again
	within an hour; and, pacing through the forest,
	chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,
	lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside,
	and mark what object did present itself:
	under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age,
	and high top bald with dry antiquity,
	a wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,
	lay sleeping on his back: about his neck
	a green and gilded snake had wreath'd itself,
	who with her head nimble in threats approach'd
	the opening of his mouth; but suddenly,
	seeing orlando, it unlink'd itself,
	and with indented glides did slip away
	into a bush; under which bush's shade
	a lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
	lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,
	when that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis
	the royal disposition of that beast
	to prey on nothing that doth seem as dead:
	this seen, orlando did approach the man,
	and found it was his brother, his elder brother.
</oliver>

<celia>	<81%>
	o! i have heard him speak of that same brother;
	and he did render him the most unnatural
	that liv'd 'mongst men.
</celia>

<oliver>	<81%>
	and well he might so do,
	for well i know he was unnatural.
</oliver>

<rosalind>	<81%>
	but, to orlando: did he leave him there,
	food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?
</rosalind>

<oliver>	<81%>
	twice did he turn his back and purpos'd so;
	but kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
	and nature, stronger than his just occasion,
	made him give battle to the lioness,
	who quickly fell before him: in which hurtling
	from miserable slumber i awak'd.
</oliver>

<celia>	<81%>
	are you his brother?
</celia>

<rosalind>	<81%>
	was it you he rescu'd?
</rosalind>

<celia>	<81%>
	was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
</celia>

<oliver>	<81%>
	'twas i; but 'tis not i. i do not shame
	to tell you what i was, since my conversion
	so sweetly tastes, being the thing i am.
</oliver>

<rosalind>	<81%>
	but, for the bloody napkin?
</rosalind>

<oliver>	<81%>
	by and by.
	when from the first to last, betwixt us two,
	tears our recountments had most kindly bath'd,
	as how i came into that desert place:—
	in brief, he led me to the gentle duke,
	who gave me fresh array and entertainment,
	committing me unto my brother's love;
	who led me instantly unto his cave,
	there stripp'd himself; and here, upon his arm
	the lioness had torn some flesh away,
	which all this while had bled; and now he fainted,
	and cried, in fainting, upon rosalind.
	brief, i recover'd him, bound up his wound;
	and, after some small space, being strong at heart,
	he sent me hither, stranger as i am,
	to tell this story, that you might excuse
	his broken promise; and to give this napkin,
	dy'd in his blood, unto the shepherd youth
	that he in sport doth call his rosalind.

<rosalind>	<86%>
	o! i know where you are. nay, 'tis true: there was never anything so sudden but the fight of two rams, and cæsar's thrasonical brag of 'i came, saw, and overcame:' for your brother and my sister no sooner met, but they looked; no sooner looked but they loved; no sooner loved but they sighed; no sooner sighed but they asked one another the reason; no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy: and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs to marriage which they will climb incontinent, or else be incontinent before marriage. they are in the very wrath of love, and they will together: clubs cannot part them.

	they shall be married to-morrow, and i will bid the duke to the nuptial. but, o! how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man's eyes. by so much the more shall i to-morrow be at the height of heart-heaviness, by how much i shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.

<rosalind>	<87%>
	why then, to-morrow i cannot serve your turn for rosalind?
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<87%>

</orlando>

<rosalind>	<87%>
	i will weary you then no longer with idle talking. know of me then,—for now i speak to some purpose,—that i know you are a gentleman of good conceit. i speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge, insomuch i say i know you are; neither do i labour for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you, to do yourself good, and not to grace me. believe then, if you please, that i can do strange things. i have, since i was three years old, conversed with a magician, most profound in his art and yet not damnable. if you do love rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out, when your brother marries aliena, shall you marry her. i know into what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient to you, to set her before your eyes to-morrow, human as she is, and without any danger.
</rosalind>

<orlando>	<88%>
	speakest thou in sober meanings?

<orlando>	<93%>
	my lord, the first time that i ever saw him,
	methought he was a brother to your daughter;
	but, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,
	and hath been tutor'd in the rudiments
	of many desperate studies by his uncle,
	whom he reports to be a great magician,
	obscured in the circle of this forest.

	there is, sure, another flood toward, and these couples are coming to the ark. here comes a pair of very strange beasts, which in all tongues are called fools.
</jaques>

<touchstone>	<93%>
	salutation and greeting to you all!
</touchstone>

<jaques>	<93%>
	good my lord, bid him welcome. this is the motley-minded gentleman that i have so often met in the forest: he hath been a courtier, he swears.
</jaques>

<touchstone>	<93%>
	if any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation. i have trod a measure; i have flattered a lady; i have been politic with my friend, smooth with mine enemy; i have undone three tailors; i have had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.
</touchstone>

<jaques>	<93%>
	and how was that ta'en up?
</jaques>

<touchstone>	<93%>
	faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause.
</touchstone>

<jaques>	<93%>
	how seventh cause? good my lord, like this fellow.
</jaques>

<duke s>	<93%>
	i like him very well.
</duke s>

<touchstone>	<93%>
	god 'ild you, sir; i desire you of the like. i press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country copulatives, to swear, and to forswear, according as marriage binds and blood breaks. a poor virgin, sir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own: a poor humour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else will. rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house, as your pearl in your foul oyster.
</touchstone>

<duke s>	<94%>
	by my faith, he is very swift and sententious.
</duke s>

<touchstone>	<94%>
	according to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.
</touchstone>

<jaques>	<94%>
	but, for the seventh cause; how did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause?
</jaques>

<touchstone>	<94%>
	upon a lie seven times removed:—bear your body more seeming, audrey:—as thus, sir. i did dislike the cut of a certain courtier's beard: he sent me word, if i said his beard was not cut well, he was in the mind it was: this is called 'the retort courteous.' if i sent him word again, it was not well cut, he would send me word, he cut it to please himself: this is called the 'quip modest.' if again, it was not well cut, he disabled my judgment: this is called the 'reply churlish.' if again, it was not well cut, he would answer, i spake not true: this is called the 'reproof valiant:' if again, it was not well cut, he would say, i lie: this is called the 'countercheck quarrelsome': and so to the 'lie circumstantial,' and the 'lie direct.'
</touchstone>

<jaques>	<95%>
	and how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?
</jaques>

<touchstone>	<95%>
	i durst go no further than the 'lie circumstantial,' nor he durst not give me the 'lie direct;' and so we measured swords and parted.
</touchstone>

<jaques>	<95%>
	can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?
</jaques>

<touchstone>	<95%>
	o sir, we quarrel in print; by the book, as you have books for good manners: i will name you the degrees. the first, the 'retort courteous;' the second, the 'quip modest;' the third, the 'reply churlish;' the fourth, the 'reproof valiant;' the fifth, the 'countercheck quarrelsome;' the sixth, the 'lie with circumstance;' the seventh, the 'lie direct.' all these you may avoid but the lie direct; and you may avoid that too, with an 'if.' i knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel; but when the parties were met themselves, one of them thought but of an 'if,' as 'if you said so, then i said so;' and they shook hands and swore brothers. your 'if' is the only peace-maker; much virtue in 'if.'
</touchstone>

<jaques>	<95%>
	is not this a rare fellow, my lord? he's as good at any thing, and yet a fool.
</jaques>

<duke s>	<95%>
	he uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit.

	let me have audience for a word or two:
	i am the second son of old sir rowland,
	that bring these tidings to this fair assembly.
	duke frederick, hearing how that every day
	men of great worth resorted to this forest,
	address'd a mighty power, which were on foot
	in his own conduct, purposely to take
	his brother here and put him to the sword:
	and to the skirts of this wild wood he came,
	where, meeting with an old religious man,
	after some question with him, was converted
	both from his enterprise and from the world;
	his crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,
	and all their lands restor'd to them again
	that were with him exil'd. this to be true,
	i do engage my life.
</jaques>

<duke s>	<98%>
	welcome, young man;
	thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:
	to one, his lands withheld; and to the other
	a land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
	first, in this forest, let us do those ends
	that here were well begun and well begot;
	and after, every of this happy number
	that have endur'd shrewd days and nights with us,
	shall share the good of our returned fortune,
	according to the measure of their states.
	meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity,
	and fall into our rustic revelry.
	play, music! and you, brides and bridegrooms all,
	with measure heap'd in joy, to the measures fall.
</duke s>

<jaques>	<98%>
	sir, by your patience. if i heard you rightly,
	the duke hath put on a religious life,
	and thrown into neglect the pompous court?
</jaques>

<jaques>	<98%>
	he hath.
</jaques>

<jaques>	<98%>
	to him will i: out of these convertites
	there is much matter to be heard and learn'd.

	it is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue; but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue. if it be true that good wine needs no bush, 'tis true that a good play needs no epilogue; yet to good wine they do use good bushes, and good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues. what a case am i in then, that am neither a good epilogue, nor cannot insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play! i am not furnished like a beggar, therefore to beg will not become me: my way is, to conjure you; and i'll begin with the women. i charge you, o women! for the love you bear to men, to like as much of this play as please you: and i charge you, o men! for the love you bear to women,—as i perceive by your simpering none of you hate them,—that between you and the women, the play may please. if i were a woman i would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased me, complexions that liked me, and breaths that i defied not; and, i am sure, as many as have good beards, or good faces, or sweet breaths, will, for my kind offer, when i make curtsy, bid me farewell.
